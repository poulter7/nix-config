# Mac Setup
This repo is a place for me to hopefully solve a perpetual problem: make every macbook I work have a similar enough look, feel and tools that switching between machines isn't a hassle.

## Getting started
git clone git@github.com:poulter7/mac-setup.git
./init.sh

## Activate this nix configuration
nix run nix-darwin -- switch --flake .
